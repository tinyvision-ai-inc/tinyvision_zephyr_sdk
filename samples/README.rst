Zephyr SDK samples
##################

While you are invited to experiment, these samples are meant for internal development of the
SDK itself. Unless you are troubleshooting the SDK internals, you might be interested in the
`tinyclunx33_zephyr_example <https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/tinyclunx33_zephyr_example>`_
repository, which contains a stable version of the samples SDK, and which you can fork as a
starting point for your project..
